Country Neighbours Tour

Angel likes to travel around neighbor countries. To help him plan his next trip you need to create a REST API accepting the following request parameters:
•	Starting (home) country
•	Budget per country (equal for all neighbor countries)
•	Total budget
•	Input Currency

Result:
1.	The API should calculate how many exact times can Angel go through all neighbor countries within his total budget.
2.	The API should calculate the budget for each country in their respected currencies. If the exchange rate is missing it should return the amount in the original currency. The potential leftover amount from the total budget should also be returned in the original currency.

Example:
Angel fills in the following request values:
•	Starting country: Bulgaria (BG)
•	Budget per country: 100
•	Total budget: 1200
•	Currency: EUR

Example Result:
Bulgaria has 5 neighbor countries (TR, GR, MK, SR, RO) and Angel can travel around them 2 times. He will have 200 EUR leftover. For Turkey he will need to buy 1325.30 TL, for North Macedonia he will need to buy 12232.51 MKD, and so on. 

Requirements:
1.	Use Java Spring Boot Framework to build the REST API
2.	Upload project to GIT/Bitbucket 
3.	You can use the following helper APIs:
